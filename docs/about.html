        <h1>Kelly Anderson</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kelly Anderson</strong>, a second year student attending
                    <em><strong>Penn State Behrend</strong></em> majoring in <em>Digital Media</em>
            and earning a certificate in <em>German Studies.</em></p>
        <p>My hobbies include...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Playing Video Games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've had a strong passion for art, mainly drawing over painting.
            Starting in 3rd grade I began to take art lessons and I took them until High School.
            I've been doing traditional art for over 11 years and digital art for 6 years. Most of
            my drawings are inspirations from video games I've played, cartoons I've watched, or
            other artist's work I've seen. My artstlye has always been a cartoony kind of style, and
            as of now, the style I draw in the most is <strong>Rubberhose.</strong> I've picked up
            more of this style from my favorite video game, <em>Cuphead.</em></p>
        <p>During High School, I was a javelin thrower and absolutely loved it. However, my javelin
            throwing career would soon come to a halt after a semester of college. In 2022, I've
            been slowly getting symptoms of <em>Tendonitis</em> in my right wrist and in 2023, the condition
            became more severe and bilateral. Javelin was stopped after my elbow had been affected
            as well. In my dominant arm, I had surgery for a <em>Cubital Tunnel Decompression.</em> The
            problem of <em>Tendonitis</em> still lingers as of early 2025.</p>
