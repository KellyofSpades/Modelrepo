            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginning to code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beginning to code with little knowledge of how to use <em>CSS</em> or <em>HTML</em>
                can be difficult to work with when making a website, but once you know how to work
                with strands of coding, it becomes much easier to do.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple files for one website</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you want to work with multiple pages on your website, multiple files need to be
                created for a navigation bar to be used. It can get cluttered really quick if you
                are not organized.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of spell check</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm terrible at spelling certain words, and not knowing something is spelled wrong
                when typing fast can make a website look off.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="resume">
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with coding over what the page would look like</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using <em>WordPress</em>, you can work in two sections of a website's page, the
                code, or the website page itself, working with the coding and saving/reloading your
                work and checking the result is much easier than working on the page's appearance
                and going from there</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy detection in errors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In <em>Oxygen</em>, if your code is broken or incorrect, the whole file will not work
                and a description of the error is given, but with <em>WordPress</em>, errors are
                usually not described as good as they could be and can still work with broken
                coding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hotkeys make things easier</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Surprisingly, copy and paste doesn't break as much as you would think on
                    <em>Oxygen</em> compared to <em>WordPress</em>. Going back through paragraphs
                and using hotkeys to insert tags is easier than manually typing everything.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy management of images</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using an image in <em>Oxygen</em> is simple, have the images in a file, reference the
                file, and give it an <strong>alt</strong> name. Using images on <em>WordPress</em>
                is the same but the code for an image is not as simple as it is in
                <em>Oxygen</em>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Well organized text and customization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using <em>WordPress</em>, every single piece of coding was exactly the same
                color, making quick navigation of errors or certain tags difficult. In
                    <em>Oxygen,</em> you can make the program look however you want to make
                navigation easier.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding how the website works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead of working on a software, now you're working in a website, building a
                website, some crazy stuff is happening. Knowing how the overall website works makes
                the actual development of a website easier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Publication is not easy to view with code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In <em>Oxygen</em>, you can view both your code and the results, but for
                    <em>WordPress</em>, you have to publish your product, then open a new tab with
                the file, and then you can see what your results look like.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No easy way to navigate code</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>WordPress</em> doesn't give much customization outside of changing the themes of
                your website, but <em>Oxygen</em> allows for any kind of altering, as long as it
                fits the CSS or is in a file for reference.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="resume">
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't necessarily need to know coding to work on a website</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>WordPress</em> has easy compatibility with copying text and pasting text right
                onto the page you want to create, it then shows the code on a different tab.
                    <em>Oxygen</em> doesn't have a feature like this so you can only make a website
                by writing the code first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy detection in spelling</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>WordPress</em> has autocorrect built in for grammar mistakes and spelling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple files are not needed and are easy to access</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>WordPress</em> keeps everything in one place while you edit a page, so adding in
                images or other forms of media are a click away over a strand of code away.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy modifications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you want to move around strands of texts or images, the page of what the code
                looks like is right in front of you to edit. Moving around these moves around the
                code automatically.</p>

        <h1>Overall Skills</h1>
        <section class="resume">
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowing how <em>CSS</em> and <em>HTML</em> work compared to <em>XML</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>XML</em> is also a coding language, but it is not similar to <em>HTML</em> or
                    <em>CSS.</em> Tags in <em>XML</em> are one of the many differences and not
                knowing which is which can make or break a website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice makes perfect</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yes, this advice works here too, it's not just with drawing, it's with any new skill
                you're trying to learn. I used to be super slow with making a page for a website,
                but now it only takes about an hour to an hour and a half compared to three or more
                hours.</p>
