        <h1>Drawing Tips</h1>
        <p>I've been drawing for over 14 years and still struggle with some things when making
            certain drawings, but if you ever wanted to get started on how to get better at drawing,
            here's some little tips to keep in mind...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Practice makes perfect</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As stupid or repetitive as this may sound, it's actually true. Take something you want to
            get good at drawing and try to draw it, now do it again, and again, eventually you'll
            get better at creating whatever it is you're doing to the point where it becomes muscle
            memory. You'll go from struggling to confident eventually, but only practice can
            help.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Try to reference over tracing</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tracing over another piece of art to add to your drawing is extremely easy to do, but
            what are you really learning from this? It's easier to look at how another person was
            able to draw something and follow along, plus you'll learn from trial and error over
            tracing and getting it right the first time, every time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Positioning/Perspective matters</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When drawing, remember that certain positions and perspectives change. If a character
            you're drawing is looking in a certain direction, keep in mind the parts facing the
            drawer are going to be much larger than the parts away from the drawer. If you're not
            really sure what this means, take a look at this image...</p>

            <figure>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Notice how the left half is more obscured and smaller compared to the right half? Looking
            at the eyes can also help see this, the left eye is much smaller compared to the right,
            which is facing the drawer.</p>
        <h1>Top Art Pieces</h1>
        <p>I've drawn a lot over the years and over time, there's many drawings I look at and hate,
            but I don't always hate old drawings. These are some of my favorite pieces I've done at
            the moment</p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <h1>Comic Ideas</h1>
        <p>I also work on comics as well, but most of the time I start drawing a comic, get side
            tracked, and then begin another and never end up finishing them. I've decided to end
            that trend and start to work on the unfinished ones more to finally finish what I
            started.</p>
        <p>Some ideas include...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A robotic version of the main character takes over their life, kind of like what AI
                is doing to the art community</li>
            <li>An overexaggerated story of the development of my bilateral tendinitis, tell how it
                happened but exaggerate certain parts to show how it affects me</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Characters</h1>
        <p>Throughout making comics, I've made a few characters to work with in the stories:</p>
        <h2>Agil Kilometer the Roadrunner</h2>
        <p>His name comes from the <em>German</em> word for "Agile" and <em>Kilometer</em> is a
            measurement of distance. Inspired from the Roadrunner from <em>Looney Tunes</em>, Agil
            is a confident, yet arrogant bird who's a master on the runways. Agil was originally
            meant to speak all in <em>German</em> and the amulet around his neck would change his
            vocals to <em>English</em>, but I changed it to just be decorative.</p>
        <h2>Astrape Mezocyklone the Cumulonimbus Cloud</h2>
        <p>His name comes from the <em>Greek</em> word for "Lightning" and <em>Mesocyclone</em>, a
            cyclonic air mass associated with supercell thunderstorms, or the storms that produce
            tornadoes. Inspired from my irrational fear of thunderstorms, Astrape is strict and
            demanding to always get his way, he's usually only seen around the person being
            afflicted and only they can see him. Astrape's gimmick works like a ghost.</p>
        <h2>Raynn Surgence the Shark</h2>
        <p>His name comes from a play on the word "Rain" and <em>Surgence</em> is a combination of
            "Surge" and "Vengeance". Raynn is a buff almost military-esque shark who's extremely
            loyal to his crew. He's the captain of a pirate ship. His crew would be different types
            of fish, <em>Swordfish</em> being the main fighters where they'd use their noses as the
            sword.</p>
        <h2>Sir Austeraus the Spartan</h2>
        <p>His name comes from the words "Austere", another word for "Spartan", and "Raus" the
                <em>German</em> word for "Out". Sir Austeraus is the strict and optimistic leader of
            the <em>Lancelings</em>, little knights with lances for noses.</p>
