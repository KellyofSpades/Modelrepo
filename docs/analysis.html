            <p>During <strong>McKinley's</strong> speeches, the use of the phrase <em>"of the United

            <p><strong>McKinley</strong> had the goal of making America up to date with many
                surrounding countries, and since this was almost the <em>20th centry</em>, America
                was still in development of becoming a booming country with the <em>Industrial
                    Revolution</em> finishing the final touches in the late <em>1800s</em>.</p>

            <p>Since the state of America was two years post <em>Cold War</em>, certain measures had to be
                taken to recover America from the effects.</p>

            <p>During <strong>Clinton's</strong> presidency, the <em>Cold War</em> was only two
                years finished, but the effects still lingered in the United States, leaving
                    <strong>Clinton</strong> to create a speech to help America.</p>
