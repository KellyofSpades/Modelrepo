                was still in development of becoming a booming country with the <em>Industrial

            <p>During <strong>Clinton's</strong> presidency, the <em>Cold War</em> was only two

        <h1>Overall Report</h1>
        <section class="resume">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>McKinley</strong> and <strong>Clinton's</strong> approach to speeches were
                always putting the countries <em>"needs"</em> into action rather than the countries
                    <em>"wants".</em> For instance, <strong>McKinley</strong> made speeches saying
                how America would proceed to become more advanced during the <em>20th century</em>,
                which at the time was seen more as a need since technology wasn't the greatest, so
                having access to large technological discoveries would show how well your country
                was doing. <strong>Clinton</strong> was president right after a war, so recovery
                from the war was critical for the United States.</p>
            <p>These kinds of features in a speech are exactly what citizens wants to hear from a
                president, development to the country and any form of benefits they can get for
                living there. Whether or not the feature is actually carried out is up to the
                president in the long run, but promises to make a country better or recovered make
                presidents of different decades look the same.</p>
